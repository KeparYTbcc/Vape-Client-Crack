## Update Messages

### 12/22/2024
- **Launcher.py** has been created:
  - It's far from perfect and may not start Vape properly. If it doesn't start automatically, you can manually start it. At least the server will be running.
- **Newer Video**: [Watch Here](https://archive.org/details/vape-v-4.mp-4)

### 12/21/2024
- **New Discord Server**: [Join Here](https://discord.gg/jFg7quHz)
- **Environment Fixes**:
  - Many users reported issues with the environment setup. The only reliable solution is to use the exact environment (ENV) from the first version/backup.
  - A better tutorial or guide is in the works. For now, use the `env` folder as specified in the "VENV" instructions.

**Future Plans**
- A simple launcher is being considered to make starting Vape easier.
- The setup process has proven challenging for some users, and individual support is no longer feasible.

**Key Learnings**
1. The **Python version** is critical.
2. Some dependencies must be updated or installed with the correct versions.
